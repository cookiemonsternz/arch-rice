# My Dotfiles

Hiya! These are my dotfiles -
My setup uses Niri + Noctalia Shell on Arch primarily themed around the Rose Pine Moon color scheme, 
with a couple of custom widgets and a complete sddm theme from scratch. You should be able to just run
install.sh - provided you have niri installed and don't mind gaining a couple new apps lol (dopamine my goat!).

If you want to get themes on most apps, you should be 
able to find them under Rosé Pine.
